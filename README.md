<h1> Pictochat Remaster Chat App </h1>

## Created By: Matthew Tenuta

## Description
Welcome to my amazing chat app.It is fully functional and 2 users could chat between browsers on the same computer. You can input your name so the other person knows who you are.

## Development
The chat app was made using Node, Vue, and Socket.

## Design
I have styled to look like Pictochat. If youâ€™re not sure what Pictochat is, it was a chat application used back in the day on the nintendo DS and you could chat between consoles and share drawings/messages. I have changed some things since this is a remastered version while still keeping the original charm.
